talk_title : Motives for Participation in FLOSS Communities
---
talk_description : For my thesis, I conducted a survey about motives and factors that encourage individuals to voluntary participate in FLOSS communities - communities which support free/ libre/ open-source software or the related philosophy and movement.

According to the conceptualization of motives categories, I explore the significance of certain motives and factors that influence individual's participation or contribution. The typology of motives is divided into the following categories: internal factors (intrinsic motivation, altruism, identification with the community), external factors (career and job opportunities, money, human capital, self-promotion and reputation building, personal needs).

I also investigate compliance of values of the participants and community values, the level of support of some of the principles of FLOSS ideology, level of presence of conventional motivation, etc.

takeaways : The survey offers an insight into the importance and value of voluntary participation for an individual in FLOSS communities. The findings can help us to a better understanding of the phenomenon and nature of FLOSS communities and projects. It can help to a better management and development of FLOSS projects themselves as well as FLOSS communities. It also provides information and encouragment for individuals to integrate into FLOSS communities and helps with their own self-actualization. It can also help FLOSS communities in acquiring new members.

Finally, if we understand this kind of motives for participation in FLOSS projects we will better understand and assess the overall social impact and the importance of free software and its associated movements.
